# Sonic 1/2 2013 Script Decompilation

a full decompilation for the scripts in Sonic 1 & 2's mobile ports

## NOTE: S2 scripts are currently incomplete, they'll be added later this week

- these scripts have been manually reverted back to what the original scripts could've looked like.
- that means that:
* function IDs have been recoverted back to function names
* some function names have been given proper names
* functions are in the proper order
* default aliases have been re-added where possible
* re-added static variables
* re-added arrays & values

- for anyone curious about how Sonic 1/2's scripting language works, check out the handbook (Handbook.pdf) I made to help get people into using RSDKv4 (S1/S2)'s scripting language
